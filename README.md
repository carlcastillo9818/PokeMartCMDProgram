# PokeMartCMDProgram
 A program that simulates a pokemart  in the command prompt using C++. It allows the user to set their in-game name, their amount of money at first.  Next, the shopping music kicks in, and the program displays a menu that allows for buying items, checking the player bag for items they already have, and also quitting the program.  When the user chooses to buy, they are presented with a menu with several options from a file that I created.  The program will notify them if they dont have enough money.  After buying something, the user can buy another thing (assuming they have enough money), or check their bag to see what they have already or just quit the program. This short project utilizes linked lists, vectors, classes, and various methods to accomplish its tasks.
